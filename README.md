# Gomoku
This game is a standard gomoku game on a 10X10 board.
The board is represented by the computer using base 4.
This allows the computer to save the board as a group of large numbers and use binary functions to simulate a chnage in the board.
Using this binary representation allows the program to run much faster, which makes it possible to brute force to a larger depth.
